Terms:
	Corss product: is a the mutiplication of 2 vectros, that are inrependent at the result is the 3rd indip. / not the same as dot product
		so it is a way to get the 3d dimensional assis form any 2 vecotres 
	Linear independence: if the one vectror cant be replecated by any combination of vector 2 then it is independent

Terms:
	Corss product: is a the mutiplication of 2 vectros, that are inrependent at the result is the 3rd indip. / not the same as dot product
		so it is a way to get the 3d dimensional assis form any 2 vecotres 
	Linear independence: if the one vectror cant be replecated by any combination of vector 2 then it is independent

how to rotate?
how to draw a line?
how to create linear gradient?

dot product:
	is the projection of a vector on to a nother vector in mat terms the cordinats of the same type get multiplied

Affine Transformations
	the the one of the plais stay paralle to other planes
Shear matrix:
	used to multiply or subtract row from row or colum from column
	its done by using identity matrix and replacing one zero value
	with a non zero value
